.. versionadded:: 3.20

The :prop_sf:`GENERATED` source file property is now visible in all directories.

Whether or not a source file is generated is an all-or-nothing global
property of the source.  Consequently, the associated ``GENERATED``
property is now visible from any directory scope, not only from the scope
for which it was set.

The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is to only allow ``GENERATED`` to be
visible from the directory scope for which it was set.  The ``NEW``
behavior on the other hand allows it to be visible from any scope.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.20.  CMake version |release|
warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior. Use the
:command:`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.
