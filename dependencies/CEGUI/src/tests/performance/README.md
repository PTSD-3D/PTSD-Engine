Performance tests
====================================

This directory contains performance tests of the CEGUI library.

The whole system uses boost::test as a driving framework and boost::timer
for measuring the time it takes to execute certain steps. The results
of each test are appended in the performance-test-results.csv file for
further later inspection.
